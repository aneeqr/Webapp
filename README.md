You can also specify several different network types:

1. drive - get drivable public streets (but not service roads)
2. drive_service - get drivable streets, including service roads
3. walk - get all streets and paths that pedestrians can use (this network type ignores one-way directionality)
4. bike - get all streets and paths that cyclists can use
5. all - download all non-private OSM streets and paths
6. all_private - download all OSM streets and paths, including private-access ones
